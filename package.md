# NPM packages

## Scripts

There are several scripts that will support you during the development and deploy process. In the end you'll probably only need two or three of them, since they often call each other.

### Common

#### `npm run build`

Creates the production build of the current code and moves it to the `/dist` folder. This will also perform **code splitting**, **critical CSS splitting** and **minification/uglyfication**. `npm run test` **MUST** be executed before building!

> NOTE: the environment had to be defined explicitly on the NODE_ENV. webpack's "--mode production" did not work, because the config was requested multiple times but switched to "development" on the second request. See https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/6460

#### `npm run dev`

Starts the development-environment with styleguide example pages. Please note, that for performance reasons no minification, uglyfication and CSS extraction is performed.

#### `npm run dev:s` or `npm run styleguide`

Starts [Vue-Styleguidist](https://github.com/vue-styleguidist/vue-styleguidist) in a separate webpack and localhost instance.

#### `npm run test`

This will test the current state of CSS and JS code. Tests **MUST** be executed before creating a build.

#### All scripts

* `npm run clean:caches` - Clears linter caches.
* `npm run dev` - See above.
* `npm run dev:s` - See above.
* `npm run jest` - Executes Jest tests.
* `npm run styleguide` - See above.
* `npm run test` - See above.
* `npm run build` - See above.
* `npm run build:profile` - Runs a build and shows a package content overview
* `npm run build:styleguide` - Creates a standalone build of the development and component styleguide.
* `npm run build:watch` - Allows to develop with a continuous productive build.
